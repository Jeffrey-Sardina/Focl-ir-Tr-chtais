artificial intelligence (AI) (concept)
The concept behind artificial intelligence msystems; or, the intelligence they ahve as an abstract concept.

artificial intelligence (AI) (system)
A computational system that aims to act as though it has intelligence or the ability to think. Artificial intelligence is not always based on machine learning, but all machine learning systems are forms of artificial intelligence.

equation
in the context of mathematics, a mathematical statement split into two parts by the sign '=', and the says that the two halves of the statement on either side have the same value.

expression
In the context of mathematics, a statement that has a value or mathematical meaning attached to it.

generative
In the context of artificial intelligence, able to create complex outout (such as long text or images) that has a passing resemblence to human works or art.

instantiation (concept)
An instance of example of a concept or framework, other than a mathematical / computational object.

instantiation (object)
The (mathematical or computational) object created by the process of instantiation from a mathematical / computational framework.

instantiation (process)
The process relating to the instantiation of a (mathematical or computational) object.

to instantiate
To create a (mathematical or computational) object, especially according to a strictly defined framework.

to weight
To attach a numerical weight to an expression or methematical object.

topology
In the context of a graph, a mathematical description of how its nodes are connected; or, the feild of mathematical study based on analysis of graph structure.

weight
In the context of machine learning or mathematics, a scalar number that is multiplied with an expression (especially to change or restrict the range of values output by that expression); or, a scalar value used as a label (such as on elements of a graph).
