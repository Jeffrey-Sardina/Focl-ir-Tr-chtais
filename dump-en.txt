entity alignment
In the context of machine learning, the task of predicting which distinct entities in a dataset actually stand for the same concept or object.

global maximum
In the context of optimisation or machine learning, the highest value that can ever be obtained.

global minimum
In the context of optimisation or machine learning, the lowest value that can ever be obtained.

local maximum
In the context of optimisation or machine learning, a value that is high compared to other values near it, but that may not be the highest possible value (i.e. that may not be a global maximum).

local minimum
In the context of optimisation or machine learning, a value that is low compared to other values near it, but that may not be the lowest possible value (i.e. that may not be a global minimum).

maximum
The highest value that can be obtained (for example, during the optimisation of a machine learning model).

minimum
The highest value that can be obtained (for example, during the optimisation of a machine learning model).
