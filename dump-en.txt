cluster
In the context of mathematics, a group of points that are close to each other, or similar to each other, according to some metric.

clustering
In the context of machine learning, the process related to assigning a class to data points when there is no knowledge in advance of what the correct labels are (or even how many there are), such that the learning must be done inductively.

rank
Regarding a value in a sorted list, the index at which that element is located.

regression
The the context of mathematics, the process relating to finding a linear equation that accurately describes the numerical patterns in a data set.
