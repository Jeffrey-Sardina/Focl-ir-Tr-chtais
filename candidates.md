Guiding principles, in order
- Gaelachas (nó, easpa Béarlachas). Many Irish terms are unnatural to Irish -- see the "Fear Fiaclach" debocle. I will attempt to make the Irish terms I use recognisable as elements of proper Irish syntax. This means, for example, a preference for genitive phrases over using one noun as a prefix to another, except in some established cases (ríomh- for example). I accept when this leads me to differ from Téarma.ie or similar.
- Clarity of meaning. An Irish speaker who understands the general principles of computer science should be able to naturally and immediately intuit the meaning of all terms as much as possible. Secondarily, an computer scientist who knows Irish,but not these terms, should be able to naturally understand what term maps to what term in English without needed to consult a list / dictionary. 
- Like origin. When I must create a new term, or use an old term in a new context, I will attempt to do so using a mirrored etymology too that of the English term. For example, Subject, object and predicate are all linguistic terms in origin, even when used to discuss KGs. As such, their adopted terms in Irish should be linguistic as well, rather than drawn from alternate versions of those terms from philosophy or some other school of thought / study.
- Simplicity (as would be understood by a native Irish speaker). Never use a more complex term when a simple one will do, and understand that loaning Eng structures (i.e. Béarlachas) is necessarily more complex than and native Irish-language structure.
- Standard. Use of the grammar / syntax of the Caighdeán Oifigiúil, as well as (as far as possible) words published in at least on generally accepted Irish-language dictionary.

Requirements
- Clear provenance. For every term, I should have clear provenance, of the term, and evidence of similar use in native or native-like speech (i.e. Teanglann).

** -- ask urthre**
all items are listed in order

Machine Learning
- foghlaim na meaisíní
- meaisínfhoghlaim

Transfer Learning
- tras-fhoghlaim
- no official term. as "tras" is an established (Productive) prefix in Irish, it is used with the word for learning (foghlaim). The dash is maintained for clarity.

Knowledge Graph, KG
- Graf Eolais, GE
- no official translation. Term is constructed from graf (graph) and eolas (knowledge).

database
- bunachar sonraí
- established term in wide use. The full term only appears on Téarma / Foclóir, but I see no reason to object to its construction in this manner. Bunachar (base) has been used for inforomation / data / etc for a while, so I amhappy to accept it in particular as well.

subject
- Ainmní
- This is the grammatical term. As triples are made as analogies to sentences, I believe using the grammatical term is appropriate in Irish as it is in English.

object
- Cuspóir
- This is the grammatical term. As triples are made as analogies to sentences, I believe using the grammatical term is appropriate in Irish as it is in English.

predicate
-  Faisnéis
- This is the grammatical term. As triples are made as analogies to sentences, I believe using the grammatical term is appropriate in Irish as it is in English.

triple
- Abairt thriarach
- Triarach is listed as a noun on Téarma, as well as an adj. This is attested in Dineen as "of or belonging to three persons or things" as an ajd. Teanglann lists it as an adjective only. I therefore reject it as a substantive term. Instead, using again the triple = sentence analogy, I translate this as a "statement of three parts", or "abairt thriarach". I beleive that that may be acceptable to simplify to "abairt" where context is clear.

relation, edge **
- ceangal.
- Ceangal seems to be more used as a tie, whereas ceangaltas is specifically noted in Ó Dónaill and Dineen as a connection. However, Ceangal is also noted in the English-Irish Dictionary as a connection between things (https://www.teanglann.ie/ga/eid/connection). Finally, ceangal is specifically noted as being (a tie / bond, if not always a "connection") between two things in general. As such, it is likely safe to use, but should be asked about further. 
- This us used in both contexts (of items that were already synonymous in English). I think the single term sufices, as I do not draw a distinction based on it

node
- Nód
- on Teanglann for mathematical use.

data
- sonraí (plural)
- on Teanglann and in wide use.

network
- líonra (o Teanglann / Dineen and in common use in that regard)

link prediction
- réamhinsint nasc
- not in any database. However, réámhinsint (prediction) and nasc (link) both exist, and direcctly imply a term.

hyperparameter
- hipear-pharaiméadar
- not in any database. However, Ó Dónall as "paraiméadar" (parameter) and "hipear-", which immediately imply a term. The dash is maintained for clarity.

model (ML)
- samhail
- Téarma lists variousn versions usingg the root samhail, includiding "samhail" and "samhaltán". Foclóir also notes "múnla". However, Teanglann has "múnla" as a mold (for metalwork) as so I reject that. Further, Teanglann has "samhaltán" as an emblem or symbol, and "samhail" as "Likeness, semblance, similitude.". Dineen has "samhlachas" as a sample or pattern type (which may be useful as a term in the thesis). Dineen has "samhail" as a reproduction or copy and does not have "samhaltán" -- as such, I accept "samhail".

embedding (process)
- leabú
- Ó Dónall has leabaigh (for physicaly embedding). However, as this is also the origin of "embed" in Eng, and as it si direcrtly analagous to embedding an idea in a (non-physical) vector space, I accept it.

embedding (the vector)
- leabú
- verbal noun go brrrr.

Knowledge Graph Embedding (process)
- TODO

Knowledge Graph Embeddings (vectors)
- TODO

Knowledge Graph Embedding Model
- TODO

dimension
- toise (Ó Dónall). THis  is one of several terms that could be "dimension" in the sense here, but is the most commonly used one (see Foclóir, Téarma) and one to which I can raise no objection.

dimensionality
- none (use a phrase with toise)
- Téarma has "toiseacht"; my intuition had been "toisíocht". Neither is attested in Teanglann or Foclóir. I opt instead to note use this term. In all cases (i.e. high dimensionality) it can be expressed using toise (or its genitive).
